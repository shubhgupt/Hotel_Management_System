# Hotel_Management_System
Java Project 
This is one of my best projects and I have used Java Swing to create its UI and No drag and drop thing is done in this project every thing is hard coded. 
In the backend we have SQL database. This project can deal with the Hotel Management very efficiently. And as per the need of the user more features can be added to it.
